This is just a practice project intended more thoroughly understand a new tech stack

The stack is Svelte + Tailwind and the Web-Api uses FSharp + Giraffe. For the Database I used SQLite

Overall it is a fun project that allows a user to translate from english to Pig Latin and show a user previous translations.
